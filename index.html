      <p> My name is Oscar Fullerton and I currently attend California State
            University, Chico. I am a junior and my major is Economics. Originally I am
            from a town called Alameda which is located in the middle of the Bay Area.
            As far as I know I have one brother and a loving mother and father. My
            brothers name is Eddy and currently he is working on getting his second
            masters in Boston. Both of my parents happily reside back home in the Bay.
            One of my crowning life achievements is playing Lacrosse in college which
            has been a dream of mine ever since I was younger. Having accomplished that
            my next is to graduate from Chico in 2019. Due to the help of a lot of
            Redbull and coffee this is totally feesible. After college I am looking to
            to Boston so that I can be closer to my brother. Looking super far into the
            future I am hoping to be swimming in millions of dollars.</p>
