      <p> On this page I am looking to show off work that I have accomplished in
        class. You can find my git hub account
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton" class="links"> here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The first project I worked on was the
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/Danese-Cooper" class="links">Danese Cooper </a>
        project where I basically created a profile page for a well renown
        computer scientist named Danese Cooper. Bascially I just created a
        page explaining who she is and where she worked for using some very
        basic HTML.
      </p>
      <P> The project I worked on after the the Danese Cooper
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/ChicoInShort" class="links"> ChicoInShort </a>
        project where I used a ordered list in html and started learning how to
        link to other pages.
      </p>
      <p> The next project I worked on was the
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/ProfessorPage" class="links"> Professor page
        </a> where I basically learned how to add style to a page using a
            separate css file instead of adding the style in the html.
      </p>
      <p> The 4th installment to my Github was my
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/MovieSpoiler" class="links"> Movie Spoiler
        </a> project where I basically had to create my first page from scratch
        describing a movie I like.
      </p>
      <p> My 5 project called
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/BuildingTabs" class="links">
          Building Tabs</a>
          I learned how to build tabs linking to other pages using a navigation bar.
      </p>
      <p> My most recent assignment was called
        <a href="https://github.com/Ofullerton/MySchedule" class="links"> My schedule
        </a> where I learned how to use psuedo-classes allowing me to include
        thinks like mouse over commands or color changing schemes.
