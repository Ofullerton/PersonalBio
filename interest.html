      <p> Like I mentioned on the home page my passion is playing lacrosse.
        My freshman year at Chico I was not able to play but fortunately I was
        given the opportunity to play my sophomore year. I began playing when I
        was in 5th grade and never looked back at any other sports. Coincidentally
        someone who is on my team was on my 5th grade team which shows how tight
        knit the community is. I think I truly grew the passion for the game in
        8th grade because that is when I became really good at it. Similarly in
        high school I didn't play my freshman year but finally came back around
        to it in sophomore year. At some point in my highschool career I had
        decided I wanted to either play against or for the University of Oregon
        Ducks in Oregon. It wasn't until last year I found myself on an 8 hour
        bus ride to do just that. I am truly blessed to be able to play every day.
        These pictures included are simply me doing what I do.

      <p> Although some of these pictures look funky(due to the different angles
        they were taken from and for the sake of making everything fit) this is
        my family. The three of them give me motivation to keep working harder
        and smarter on everything I do. My mom is a self employed baby-sitter and
        caretaker for elderly people. My dad is a truck driver for Fedex and my
        brother works at Fedex Trade Networks in Boston. Being with them is one
        my interests because all of our relationships mostly take place over phone
        because we are almost never in the same place at the same time making
        everytime we are together special.

      <p> My friends (mostly the guy to my right in the first picture) tend to
        have nice cameras and I am always the first to get some new pictures on
        my Instagram. Some times when we are in the bay we look for cool spots
        to pose at. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of them on my computer
        but it keeps us out of trouble and it's a good way to show people what I
        am up to. At the end of the day we have something to show for our efforts
        especially when we get a new piece of clothing that we like.
