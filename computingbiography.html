      <h2> Computing Biography </h2>
      <p> In all honesty I took this class because it was a requirement in order
        to get my degree in economics. Coming into this class I had no idea what
        this would entail and wether or not I was capable of being good at it.
        Luckily I find this class to be very interesting. Alternatively I didn't
        want to spend my weekend doing this project but I found myself getting
        very into it. I actually am considering taking a few other web developement
        classes. So although my computer science biography is limited to this class
        I hope to add a good amount of items to the list before I graduate.
        But because I don't have anything else here's a picture of my computer
        setup.
